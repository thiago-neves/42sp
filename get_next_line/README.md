# Get next line
Subject introduction:

> This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

## Hot to use

This function is very useful to use for reading files in a loop, line by line. you'll have to call get_next_line(int fd, **line), the fd being the opened file and **line is a address to an pointer where the function will use to put the next line everytime you call it.
