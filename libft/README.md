# Libft
Subject introduction:
> C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects. Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

## Getting started

To be able to use the library functions you'll have to compile the library using the `make` command, it'll generate a file called libft.a.

## Makefile commands

```make``` compile and generates the libft.a.

```make clean``` clean all the .o files from the folder.

```make fclean``` executes the `make clean` command and remove libft.a from the folder.

```make re``` executes the `make clean` and `make` commands to recompile the library.

```make n```executes the norminette.
